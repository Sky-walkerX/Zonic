### Environment Variables

This project requires two separate `.env` files. Create them based on the examples below. **Never commit your `.env` files containing secrets to Git.** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` files.

*   **`backend/.env`:** (Create this file in the `backend` directory)
    ```dotenv
    # Spotify Credentials (Required)
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="e03a236e3b9044bc95cf871699d4a6ed"
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="7cb88ff52b7544ed8e3835eac016bed9"
    SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback

    # App URLs (Required)
    FRONTEND_URI=http://localhost:5173
    PORT=5000 # Or another port for the backend

    # External API Keys (Required for Insights)
    NEWS_API_KEY="2a5a5ec41c924863821840c39b40f82b"
    GIPHY_API_KEY="s2aqwnXetgAXhdI7ZWbO812golV0aFZq"
    GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY="AIzaSyANz0EqMsst1eyRkpkLhuUPEMQZn228cX4"
    GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="614af4e5a2f9548f7"
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="8b7c05d4c1763a81dfc801a50548f7e9"
    ```

*   **`frontend/.env`:** (Create this file in the `frontend` directory)
    ```dotenv
    # Base URL for the backend API during development
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```

## üèÉ Running Locally

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev # Or node server.js if not using nodemon
    ```
    *(Make sure `backend/package.json` script points to the correct server file, e.g., `server.js` or `index.js`)*

2.  **Start the Frontend Dev Server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser to the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## üì¶ NPM Packages Used

### Backend (`backend/package.json`)

*   **`express`:** The core web framework for Node.js. Used to create the server, define API routes (URLs), and handle HTTP requests and responses.
*   **`axios`:** A promise-based HTTP client. Used by the backend to make requests *to* external APIs (Spotify, NewsAPI, OpenWeatherMap, Giphy, Google Search).
*   **`cors`:** Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Allows your frontend (running on a different origin/port) to make requests to this backend server securely.

*   **`dotenv`:** Loads environment variables (like secret API keys) from a `.env` file into `process.env`, keeping secrets out of the main codebase.

*   **`cookie-parser`:** Middleware to parse `Cookie` header data attached to client requests, making it available in `req.cookies`. Used here for securely handling the Spotify OAuth `state` parameter.

*   **`uuid`:** Generates unique identifiers (UUIDs). Used here to create a secure, unpredictable `state` value for the Spotify OAuth flow to prevent CSRF attacks.

*   **`body-parser`:** Middleware to parse incoming request bodies, particularly JSON data sent from the frontend.

*   **`nodemon`:** Automatically restarts the Node.js server when file changes are detected, speeding up development.

### Frontend (`frontend/package.json`)

*(Based on typical Vite/React/Shadcn setup - add/remove as needed)*

*   **`typescript`:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.

*   **`tailwindcss`:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling components.

*   **`@radix-ui/*` & `shadcn-ui`:** Foundational components and tooling for the Shadcn UI component library.

*   **`axios`:** Used by the frontend to make HTTP requests *to* your backend API endpoints (e.g., `/api/weather`, `/playlists`).

*   **`react-router-dom`:** Handles client-side routing, allowing navigation between different "pages" (like `/` and `/insights`) without full page reloads.

*   **`react-icons`:** Library providing easy access to various icon sets (like Font Awesome - `FaPlay`, `FaSearch`, etc.).
